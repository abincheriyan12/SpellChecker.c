For the network spellchecker program, we were supposed to develop a server
program that performs spell checking on demand. The spell checker server
will acquire/read words and then see if the word is in the provided dictionary.
If the word is in the provided dictionary then it will be considered spelled
correctly and if it isnâ€™t, then it will be considered misspelled. The dictionary
file was provided to us (dictionary.txt) in a .txt format file and it consists of
almost all the words that are found in a dictionary but not all the words. When the
server starts, the main thread opens the dictionary file and reads it into some data
structure accessible by all the threads in the program. You also create a fixed data
structure that will be used to store the socket descriptors. The main thread creates a
pool of workers and they begin accepting and distributing connection requests. The checked
words will be logged into a log file with the help of the logger thread.
